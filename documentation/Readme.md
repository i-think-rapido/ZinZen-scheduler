## Documentation

This folder attempts to keep a living permanent documentation of both the [functional](functional/Readme.md) aspects
of the ZinZen&reg;-scheduler, and the [technical architecture](technical/Readme.md) of the code-base.

A good place to start understanding the scheduling algorithm is the [Algorithm Overview](functional/Algorithm-Overview.md) 
page.

If you rather dive in to the code head-first a good place to start is the [Development Setup](technical/Development-Setup.md)
page.
