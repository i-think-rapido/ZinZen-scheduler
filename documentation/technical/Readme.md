## Technical information

All technical information for the ZinZen&reg;-scheduler lives in this folder.

For an overview of the development setup necessary to run the project, see [Development-Setup](Development-Setup.md)

If you run into any troubles, look at [the Troubleshooting page](Troubleshooting.md) first.
If you encounter any troubles yourself and have a potential fix, do not hesitate to add it to the Troubleshooting page.

A high-level overview of the structure of the code-base can be found in [the Project Structure page](Project-Structure.md).

If an important architectural decision is made, it is best practice to document it as an ADR (Architectural Decision Record).
This way there is always a reference of what architectural decisions are already made. You can find them in [the ADR folder](../ADR).
