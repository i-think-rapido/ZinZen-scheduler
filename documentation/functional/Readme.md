## Functional information

All documentation related to how the scheduling algorithm is designed can be
found here.

On the [Concepts](Concepts.md) page a description of all abstract concepts can 
be found.

On the [Algorithm Overview](Algorithm-Overview.md) page these concepts are used to 
describe step-by-step how the scheduling algorithm works.

The pdf [ZinZen Algorithm Test Case Simple](ZinZen%20Algorithm%20Test%20Case%20Simple.pdf) visually
represents an algorithm test run scheduling 3 simple goals. The PDF contains 
a detailed description of each step and is a good place to start understanding
(a simple case) of the algorithm.
