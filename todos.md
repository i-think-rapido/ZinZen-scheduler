# Open

- [ ] TimeFilter should not be usize. NaiveDateTime instead
- [ ] Why has Slot an End Date? Shouldn't it always be 1h after start_date
- [ ] normalize input dates of goal to the full hour


# Closed

- [x] Change GoalMap to HashMap - premature optimization is the root of all evil
- [x] Input struct remove calendar from field name and use start_date and end_date instead
- [x] sort Repetition in a nice way

# Abendoned
