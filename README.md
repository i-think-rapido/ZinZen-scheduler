## Welcome friend!

If you like Rust and scheduling algorithms you've come to the right place :) We
can talk big-O, add features or optimize hot loops.

## ZinZen&reg;
ZinZen&reg; is a platform for stress-free life planning. It works by defining life goals with constraints and dependencies.
An automatic scheduler then schedules tasks in a calendar to reach these goals, auto-magically updating the schedule when
goals or constraints change.

This repository contains the ZinZen&reg;-scheduler. The scheduler consists of a WASM-module written in Rust
that can be called from the React-based UI application.

The ZinZen&reg; UI application can be found here: [ZinZen&reg; Github](https://github.com/tijlleenders/ZinZen)



## Getting started
All documentation can be found in the folder [documentation](documentation/Readme.md).
In this folder you will find a [technical know-how base](documentation/technical/Readme.md),
as well as all the necessary [functional documentation](documentation/functional/Readme.md) to understand the
scheduling algorithms and all the concepts introduced in the ZinZen&reg;-scheduler.

For a quick set-up guide see the [Development Setup page](documentation/technical/Development-Setup.md).
